  abstract = {The growing awareness of the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation on natural systems has resulted in a rapidly increasing number of actions to reduce current fragmentation of natural systems as well as a growing demand for tools to predict and evaluate the effect of changes in the landscape on connectivity in the natural world. Recent studies used `least-cost' modelling (available as a toolbox in GIS-systems) to calculate `effective distance', a measure for distance modified with the cost to move between habitat patches based on detailed geographical information on the landscape as well as behavioural aspects of the organisms studied. We applied the method to a virtual landscape and a small scaled agricultural system subject to different scenarios in a land re-allotment project. We discuss the importance of technical aspects and ecological assumption underlying this modelling method. The model is shown to be a flexible tool to model functional connectivity in the study of the relation between landscape and mobility of organisms as well as in scenario building and evaluation in wild life protection projects and applied land management projects. Since `effective distance' has the same units as Euclidean distance (m), this effective distance may be a straightforward way to include landscape and behavioural aspects in other models which include distance as a measure for isolation. We show the importance of the `ecological' quality of the input maps and the choice of relevant landscape features and resistance values.},

  abstract = {Least-cost models for focal species are widely used to design wildlife corridors. To evaluate the least-cost modeling approach used to develop 15 linkage designs in southern California, USA, we assessed robustness of the largest and least constrained linkage. Species experts parameterized models for eight species with weights for four habitat factors (land cover, topographic position, elevation, road density) and resistance values for each class within a factor (e.g., each class of land cover). Each model produced a proposed corridor for that species. We examined the extent to which uncertainty in factor weights and class resistance values affected two key conservation-relevant outputs, namely, the location and modeled resistance to movement of each proposed corridor. To do so, we compared the proposed corridor to 13 alternative corridors created with parameter sets that spanned the plausible ranges of biological uncertainty in these parameters. Models for five species were highly robust (mean overlap 88\%, little or no increase in resistance). Although the proposed corridors for the other three focal species overlapped as little as 0\% (mean 58\%) of the alternative corridors, resistance in the proposed corridors for these three species was rarely higher than resistance in the alternative corridors (mean difference was 0.025 on a scale of 1--10; worst difference was 0.39). As long as the model had the correct rank order of resistance values and factor weights, our results suggest that the predicted corridor is robust to uncertainty. The three carnivore focal species, alone or in combination, were not effective umbrellas for the other focal species. The carnivore corridors failed to overlap the predicted corridors of most other focal species and provided relatively high resistance for the other focal species (mean increase of 2.7 resistance units). Least-cost modelers should conduct uncertainty analysis so that decision-makers can appreciate the potential impact of model uncertainty on conservation decisions. Our approach to uncertainty analysis (which can be called a worst-case scenario approach) is appropriate for complex models in which distribution of the input parameters cannot be specified.},

  abstract = {Point cloud is point sets defined in 3D metric space. Point cloud has become one of the most significant data format for 3D representation. Its gaining increased popularity as a result of increased availability of acquisition devices, such as LiDAR, as well as increased application in areas such as robotics, autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality. Deep learning is now the most powerful tool for data processing in computer vision, becoming the most preferred technique for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and detection. While deep learning techniques are mainly applied to data with a structured grid, point cloud, on the other hand, is unstructured. The unstructuredness of point clouds makes use of deep learning for its processing directly very challenging. Earlier approaches overcome this challenge by preprocessing the point cloud into a structured grid format at the cost of increased computational cost or lost of depth information. Recently, however, many state-of-the-arts deep learning techniques that directly operate on point cloud are being developed. This paper contains a survey of the recent state-of-the-art deep learning techniques that mainly focused on point cloud data. We first briefly discussed the major challenges faced when using deep learning directly on point cloud, we also briefly discussed earlier approaches which overcome the challenges by preprocessing the point cloud into a structured grid. We then give the review of the various state-of-the-art deep learning approaches that directly process point cloud in its unstructured form. We introduced the popular 3D point cloud benchmark datasets. And we also further discussed the application of deep learning in popular 3D vision tasks including classification, segmentation and detection.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial laser scanning of conifer tree crowns is challenged by occlusion problems causing sparse point clouds for many trees. Automatic segmentation of conifer tree crowns from sparse point clouds is a task that has only recently been addressed and not solved in a way that all trees can be segmented automatically without assignment errors. We developed a new segmentation algorithm that is based on region growing from seeds in voxelized 3D laser point clouds. In our data, field measured tree positions and diameters were available as input data to estimate crown cores as seeds for the region growing. In other applications, these seeds can be derived from the laser point cloud. Segmentation success was judged visually in the 3D voxel clouds for 1294 tree crowns of Norway spruce and Scots pine on 24 plots in six mixed species stands. Only about half of the tree crowns had only minor or no segmentation errors allowing to fit concentric crown models. Segmentation errors were most often caused by unsegmented neighbors at the edge of the sample plots. Wrong assignments of crown parts were also more frequent in dense groups of trees and for understory trees. For some trees, point clouds were too sparse to describe the crown. Segmentation success rates were considerably higher for dominant trees in the plot center. Despite the incomplete automatic segmentation of tree crowns, metrics describing crown size and crown shape could be derived for a large number of sample trees. A description of the irregular shape of tree crowns was not possible for most trees due to the sparse point clouds in the upper crown of most trees.},

  abstract = {The concept of nearness and that nearer things are more connected is useful in quantifying a variety of geographical patterns and processes, including ecological connectivity between geographic locations. In some ecological systems connectivity does not follow nearness relations defined by Euclidean distances, so distance must be measured another way. Least-cost modelling is a technique that can incorporate traversal costs across a landscape to measure the least-cost distance between locations as a function of both the distance travelled and the costs traversed. There has been a significant increase in the interest and use of least-cost modelling by ecologists in the last decade. However, perhaps because early applications of least-cost modelling in ecology tended to cite the method with reference to geographic information system software rather than the geographical science literature, ecologists are not currently making full use of available least-cost modelling techniques that have continued to develop. This review aims to describe the concepts of least-cost modelling, demonstrate current applications of least-cost modelling in landscape ecology, and to suggest future opportunities by linking the ecological application of least-cost modelling with recent geographical science developments from which leastcost modelling originally developed.},

Using a global lake data set, we show that the availability of phosphorus, a limiting nutrient, affects both annual nitrogen removal rate and efficiency. This result indicates that increased phosphorus inputs from human activities have stimulated nitrogen removal processes in many lakes. Recent management-driven reductions in phosphorus availability promote water column accumulation and export of nitrogen from large lakes, an unintended consequence of single-element management that argues for greater control of nitrogen as well as phosphorus sources.},

  abstract = {The segmentation of individual trees from forest point clouds is a crucial task for downstream analyses such as carbon sequestration estimation. Recently, deeplearning-based methods have been proposed which show the potential of learning to segment trees. Since these methods are trained in a supervised way, the question arises how general models can be obtained that are applicable across a wide range of settings. So far, training has been mainly conducted with data from one specific laser scanning type and for specific types of forests. In this work, we train one segmentation model under various conditions, using seven diverse datasets found in literature, to gain insights into the generalization capabilities under domain-shift. Our results suggest that a generalization from coniferous dominated sparse point clouds to deciduous dominated high-resolution point clouds is possible. Conversely, qualitative evidence suggests that generalization from highresolution to low-resolution point clouds is challenging. This emphasizes the need for forest point clouds with diverse data characteristics for model development. To enrich the available data basis, labeled trees from two previous works were propagated to the complete forest point cloud and are made publicly available at https://doi.org/10.25625/QUTUWU.},

  abstract = {Laser-scanned point clouds of forests make it possible to extract valuable information for forest management. To consider single trees, a forest point cloud needs to be segmented into individual tree point clouds. Existing segmentation methods are usually based on hand-crafted algorithms, such as identifying trunks and growing trees from them, and face difficulties in dense forests with overlapping tree crowns. In this study, we propose TreeLearn, a deep learning-based approach for tree instance segmentation of forest point clouds. TreeLearn is trained on already segmented point clouds in a data-driven manner, making it less reliant on predefined features and algorithms. Furthermore, TreeLearn is implemented as a fully automatic pipeline and does not rely on extensive hyperparameter tuning, which makes it easy to use. Additionally, we introduce a new manually segmented benchmark forest dataset containing 156 full trees. The data is generated by mobile laser scanning and contributes to create a larger and more diverse data basis for model development and fine-grained instance segmentation evaluation. We trained TreeLearn on forest point clouds of 6665 trees, labeled using the Lidar360 software. An evaluation on the benchmark dataset shows that TreeLearn performs as well as the algorithm used to generate its training data. Furthermore, the performance can be vastly improved by fine-tuning the model using manually annotated datasets. We evaluate TreeLearn on our benchmark dataset and the Wytham Woods dataset, outperforming the recent SegmentAnyTree, ForAINet and TLS2Trees methods. The TreeLearn code and all datasets that were created in the course of this work are made publicly available.},

Image technologies, as compared to traditional fire detection approaches, hold a lot of promise for overcoming the problem of a high false alarm rate. However, one of the key drawbacks of these systems is their time-consuming and labor-intensive creation. In fact, multifeature techniques, such as chromatic characteristics, dynamic features, texture features, and contour features, are frequently used to create implemented algorithms. Therefore, we provide, in this paper, a study of some transfer learning model, and we compare it to a proposed model based on convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm. To do this, we consider a proper database composed by a total of 28334 images classified into three categories: 7329 fire images, 9205 smoke images and 11800 other images.},

  abstract = {The ability of a species to exhibit behavioural plasticity to environmental conditions has consequences for its success in fragmented landscapes. The roe deer, Capreolus capreolus (L., 1758), is one of the foremost examples of behavioural flexibility among ungulates. This species has increased rapidly in range from its original forest-mosaic habitat into open agricultural plains. Open-land roe deer populations show distinct differences in spatial and social behaviour, including larger group sizes, compared with forest-living roe deer populations. This is traditionally viewed as an antipredator strategy. The presence of strong behavioural plasticity in species response to landscape structure suggests that this should also be a concern in models attempting to describe effects of landscape change on species distribution. To date the implications of behavioural plasticity for modelling species' response to environmental conditions has received little attention. We used an individual-based model of roe deer to evaluate the consequences of behavioural plasticity for predictions made regarding population response to woodland fragmentation. The inclusion of a flexible behavioural strategy, where increased group size could buffer lack of woodland cover, resulted in significantly higher estimates of population size, population persistence, and the ability of the population to cope with fragmentation. This clearly demonstrates that behavioural plasticity in species response to landscape structure may affect our ability to accurately predict the effects of landscape change and should be a concern to modellers.},

Plot scale remote sensing techniques show great promise in extracting detailed forest measurements rapidly and cheaply, however, they have been held back from large-scale implementation due to the complex and time-consuming workflows required to utilize them. This work is focused on describing and evaluating an approach to create a robust, sensor-agnostic and fully automated forest point cloud measurement tool called the Forest Structural Complexity Tool (FSCT). The performance of FSCT is evaluated using 49 forest plots of terrestrial laser scanned (TLS) point clouds and 7022 destructively sampled manual diameter measurements of the stems. FSCT was able to match 5141 of the reference diameter measurements fully automatically with mean, median and root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 0.032 m, 0.02 m, and 0.103 m respectively. A video demonstration is also provided to qualitatively demonstrate the diversity of point cloud datasets that the tool is capable of measuring. FSCT is provided as open source, with the goal of enabling plot scale remote sensing techniques to replace most structural forest mensuration in research and industry. Future work on this project will seek to make incremental improvements to this methodology to further improve the reliability and accuracy of this tool in most high-resolution forest point clouds.},

In order to detect genetic discontinuities, we screened 12 polymorphic microsatellites on 222 individuals out of 11 roe deer populations that were sampled on the east and the westside of a fenced motorway in Central Switzerland. The interaction between landscape structure and microevolutionary processes such as gene flow and drift were assessed and evaluated by different population genetic methods like F-statistics, Mantel test, spatial autocorrelation analyses, Monmonier algorithm, and principal component analysis in conjunction with geographic information system data (synthesis map). We revealed an influence of the transportation infrastructure on genetic divergence of the roe deer population examined, but no impact on genetic diversity was detected. Based on the achieved genetic findings, recommendations for management implementation were made.},

  abstract = {Earth's nitrogen (N) cycle is imbalanced because of excessive anthropogenic inputs. Freshwater lakes efficiently remove N from surface waters by transformation of NO3- to atmospheric N2 and/or N2O (denitrification; DN) and by burial of organic N in sediments (net sedimentation; NS). However, relatively little is known about the controlling environmental conditions, and few long-term measurements on individual lakes are available to quantify conversion rates. We report N-elimination rates in 21 Swiss lakes estimated from whole-lake N budgets covering up to {$\sim$}20 years of monitoring. The NO3- concentration in the bottom water was the main predictor of DN. Additionally, DN rates were positively correlated with external N load and the area-specific hydraulic loading rate (mean depth/water residence time; Qs). NS of N was strongly related to total phosphorus (P) concentration. Nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE), the fraction of the load of dissolved N to a lake removed by DN and NS, was strongly negatively related to Qs. This previously unconsidered variable improves the predictability of NRE and does not require knowledge of N and P loading rates or concentrations. We conclude that P management alone intended to oligotrophy lakes only slightly increases N export unless it is accompanied by N management.},

  abstract = {Habitat ranking is often assumed to reflect food availability, but habitat selection may involve trade-offs, for example, between selecting for food or cover. We tested whether the habitat selection of 27 radio-collared European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and 10 free-ranging domestic sheep (Ovis aries) on a forest range in southern Norway reflected resource availability. We predicted that ruminants of different feeding types would use habitats according to the main forage class, but that antipredator behavior might remove the correlation between habitat selection and food availability, thus making temporal and spatial scaling crucial. As predicted, habitat selection by sheep was highly correlated with grass availability on both the home-range and study-area scales. The habitat ranking of roe deer habitat selection did not correlate with the availability of herbs on either scale, but rather was correlated with the availability of canopy cover. We found a clear effect of temporal scale on habitat selection by roe deer. During summer, roe deer used forest habitats with more forage to a greater extent when they were active than when they were inactive, and tended to use habitats with greater availability of herbs at night. We conclude that scale-dependent trade-offs in habitat selection may cause inconsistent habitat rankings when pooled across temporal and spatial scales.},

Despite the growing need for detailed tree data, automating segmentation and tracking scientific progress remains difficult. Existing methodologies often overfit small datasets and lack comparability, limiting their applicability. Amid the progress triggered by the emergence of deep learning methodologies, standardized benchmarking assumes paramount importance in these research domains. This data paper introduces a benchmarking dataset for dense airborne laser scanning data, aimed at advancing instance and semantic segmentation techniques and promoting progress in 3D forest scene segmentation. The FOR-instance dataset comprises five curated and ML-ready UAV-based laser scanning data collections from diverse global locations, representing various forest types. The laser scanning data were manually annotated into individual trees (instances) and different semantic classes (e.g. stem, woody branches, live branches, terrain, low vegetation). The dataset is divided into development and test subsets, enabling method advancement and evaluation, with specific guidelines for utilization. It supports instance and semantic segmentation, offering adaptability to deep learning frameworks and diverse segmentation strategies, while the inclusion of diameter at breast height data expands its utility to the measurement of a classic tree variable. In conclusion, the FOR-instance dataset contributes to filling a gap in the 3D forest research, enhancing the development and benchmarking of segmentation algorithms for dense airborne laser scanning data.},

To address this issue, iron ions (Fe3+) were introduced into PVA/cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) films, and Fe3+ formed coordination bonds with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of CNF and PVA chains. Therefore, constructing a strong coordination crosslinking network within the film and improving the interfacial interaction between PVA and CNF. The water resistance, mechanical and barrier properties of the crosslinked films were significantly improved. Compared with the un-crosslinked film, the oxygen transmission rate (OTR) was decreased by up to 67~\%, and the water swelling ratio was significantly reduced from 1085~\% to 352~\%. The tensile strength of the film with 1.5~wt\% Fe3+ reached 41.93~MPa, which was 62~\% higher than that of the un-crosslinked film. Furthermore, the composite film demonstrated good recyclability, almost recovering its original mechanical properties in two recycling tests. This simple and effective method for preparing water resistance and barrier films shows potential applications in flexible packaging areas.},

Practitioners will therefore need to evaluate and act to enhance the degree to which habitat patches scattered throughout the landscape may function as stepping stones facilitating dispersal among otherwise isolated habitat areas.                                                     We formulate a new generalized network model of habitat connectivity that accounts for the number of dispersing individuals and for long-distance dispersal processes across generations. By doing so, we bridge the gap between complex dynamic population models, which are generally too data demanding and hence difficult to apply in practical wide-scale decision-making, and simpler static connectivity models that only consider the amount of habitat that can be reached by a single average disperser during its life span.                                                     We find that the loss of intermediate and sufficiently large stepping-stone habitat patches can cause a sharp decline in the distance that can be traversed by species (critical spatial thresholds) that cannot be effectively compensated by other factors previously regarded as crucial for long-distance dispersal (fat-tailed dispersal kernels, source population size).                                                                          We corroborate our findings by showing that our model largely outperforms previous connectivity models in explaining the large-scale range expansion of a forest bird species, the Black Woodpecker                     Dryocopus martius                     , over a 20-year period.                                                                        The capacity of species to exploit the opportunities created by networks of stepping-stone patches largely depends on species-specific life-history traits, suggesting that species assemblages traversing fragmented landscapes may be exposed to a spatial filtering process driving long-term changes in community composition.                                                                          Synthesis and applications                     . Previous static connectivity models seriously underestimate the importance of stepping-stone patches in sustaining rare but crucial dispersal events. We provide a conceptually broader model that shows that stepping stones (i) must be of sufficient size to be of conservation value, (ii) are particularly crucial for the spread of species (either native or invasive) or genotypes over long distances and (iii) can effectively reduce the isolation of the largest habitat blocks in reserves, therefore largely contributing to species persistence across wide spatial and temporal scales.                                                                           ,              Previous static connectivity models seriously underestimate the importance of stepping-stone patches in sustaining rare but crucial dispersal events.

  abstract = {Forests worldwide play a critical role in biodiversity conservation and climate regulation, yet they face unprecedented challenges, particularly from wildfires. Early wildfire detection is essential for preventing rapid spread, protecting lives, ecosystems, and economies, and mitigating climate change impacts. Traditional wildfire detection methods relying on human surveillance are limited in scope and efficiency. However, advancements in remote sensing technologies offer new opportunities for more efficient and comprehensive detection. This study highlights the integration of satellite sensors, capable of detecting thermal anomalies, smoke plumes, and vegetation health changes, with machine learning, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to enhance detection efficiency and accuracy. These algorithms analyse satellite data to identify fire patterns and provide near real-time alerts. SVMs' adaptability over time improves performance, making them suitable for evolving fire regimes influenced by climate change. Focusing on the Wolgan Valley in Eastern Australia, the study utilised Landsat-8 imagery and SVMs to detect active fires and classify burned areas. Results demonstrated that combining various spectral bands, such as the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) and Near-Infrared (NIR), enhances the identification of active fires and smoke. The introduction of the Normalized Difference Fire Index (NDFI) further refines detection capabilities by leveraging distinct spectral characteristics from Landsat 8 imagery. Despite the promise of these technologies, challenges such as data availability and model interpretability remain. Future research should focus on integrating diverse data sources, advancing machine learning techniques, developing realtime monitoring systems, addressing model interpretability, integrating unmanned aerial vehicles, and considering climate change impacts. This study underscores the potential of machine learning algorithms and innovative indices like NDFI to improve wildfire detection and management strategies, ultimately enhancing our ability to protect lives and ecosystems in fire-prone regions.},

Species loss is unlikely to occur immediately, however. Rather, populations of susceptible species are expected to decline gradually after road construction, with local extinction occurring sometime later. We document lags in wetland biodiversity loss in response to road construction by fitting regression models that express species richness of different taxa (birds, mammals, plants, and herptiles) as a function of both current and historical road densities on adjacent lands. The proportion of variation in herptile and bird richness explained by road densities increased significantly when past densities were substituted for more current densities in multiple regression models. Moreover, for vascular plants, birds, and herptiles, there were significant negative effects of historical road densities when the most current densities were controlled statistically. Our results provide evidence that the full effects of road construction on wetland biodiversity may be undetectable in some taxa for decades. Such lags in response to changes in anthropogenic stress have important implications for land-use planning and environmental impact assessment.},

Connectivity is defined as the degree to which a landscape facilitates or impedes movement of organisms among resource patches. However, connectivity is actually used in a variety of ways in the literature. This has led to confusion and lack of clarity related to (1) function vs structure, (2) patch isolation vs landscape connectivity and, (3) corridors vs connectivity. We suggest the term connectivity should be reserved for its original purpose. We highlight nine studies; these include modeling studies that actually measured connectivity in accordance with the definition, and empirical studies that measured key components of connectivity. We found that measurements of connectivity provide results that can be interpreted as recommending habitat fragmentation to enhance landscape connectivity. We discuss reasons for this misleading conclusion, and suggest a new way of quantifying connectivity, which avoids this problem. We also recommend a method for reducing sampling intensity in landscape-scale empirical studies of connectivity.},

However, the enhancement of fire model generalization performance still faces challenges due to limitations in existing fire datasets, such as image quantity and heteroge\- neity. Taking the advantage of rapid advancements in remote sensing technology and artificial intelligence, we introduce the Flame And Smoke Detection Dataset (FASDD), a pioneering collection comprising over 120,000 heterogeneous images covering various fire scenarios, aiming to promote the evolution of fire detection models. FASDD serves as a challenging benchmark for object detection tasks and features three sub-datasets: FASDD\_CV, FASDD\_UAV, and FASDD\_RS. These sub-datasets comprise cross-domain images from groundbased, airborne, and spaceborne sensors, respectively. Extensive experiments using advanced Swin Transformer models demonstrate satisfactory fire detection performance, with mAP scores of 84.9\%, 89.7\%, and 74.0\% on the respective sub-datasets. Notably, the application case in wildfire localization highlights the proficiency of FASDD\_RS models for monitoring and tracking forest fires. Trained on FASDD\_RS, FASDD\_UAV, and FASDD\_CV, deep learning models can be individually deployed on edge devices including satellites, drones, and terrestrial sensors, thus empowering collaborative fire warning within the space-air-ground integrated observation network. Additionally, a standardized procedure for data preparation, data proce\- dure, and quality assurance is established, providing off-the-shelf annotations with four com\- mon configurations to facilitate machine learning model training. FASDD stands as a pivotal benchmark, providing valuable resources for training and evaluating deep learning fire detec\- tion models, especially Large Vision Models (LVM). It holds the potential to accelerate research progress in urban firefighting or forest fire detection, providing vital security measures for early fire warning and emergency response tasks.},

  abstract = {Inthis study, we introduce Point2Tree, a modular and versatile framework that employs a three-tiered methodology, inclusive of semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and hyperparameter optimization analysis, designed to process laser point clouds in forestry. The semantic segmentation stage is built upon the Pointnet++ architecture and is primarily tasked with categorizing each point in the point cloud into meaningful groups or 'segments', specifically in this context, differentiating between diverse tree parts, i.e., vegetation, stems, and coarse woody debris. The category for the ground is also provided. Semantic segmentation achieved an F1-score of 0.92, showing a high level of accuracy in classifying forest elements. In the instance segmentation stage, we further refine this process by identifying each tree as a unique entity. This process, which uses a graph-based approach, yielded an F1-score of approximately 0.6, signifying reasonable performance in delineating individual trees. The third stage involves a hyperparameter optimization analysis, conducted through a Bayesian strategy, which led to performance improvement of the overall framework by around four percentage points. Point2Tree was tested on two datasets, one from a managed boreal coniferous forest in V\aa ler, Norway, with 16 plots chosen to cover a range of forest conditions. The modular design of the framework allows it to handle diverse pointcloud densities and types of terrestrial laser scanning data.},

A diverse set of stakeholders---representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers---have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

  abstract = {Accurate measurements of the structural characteristics of trees such as height, diameter, sweep and taper are an important part of forest inventories in managed forests and commercial plantations. Both terrestrial and aerial LiDAR are currently employed to produce pointcloud data from which inventory metrics can be determined. Terrestrial/ground-based scanning typically provides pointclouds resolutions of many thousands of points per m2 from which tree stems can be observed and inventory measurements made directly, whereas typical resolutions from aerial scanning (tens of points per m2) require inventory metrics to be regressed from LiDAR variables using inventory reference data collected from the ground. Recent developments in miniaturised LiDAR sensors are enabling aerial capture of pointclouds from low-flying aircraft at high-resolutions (hundreds of points per m2) from which tree stem information starts to become directly visible, enabling the possibility for plot-scale inventories that do not require access to the ground. In this paper, we develop new approaches to automated tree detection, segmentation and stem reconstruction using algorithms based on deep supervised machine learning which are designed for use with aerially acquired high-resolution LiDAR pointclouds. Our approach is able to isolate individual trees, determine tree stem points and further build a segmented model of the main tree stem that encompasses tree height, diameter, taper, and sweep. Through the use of deep learning models, our approach is able to adapt to variations in pointcloud densities and partial occlusions that are particularly prevalent when data is captured from the air. We present results of our algorithms using high-resolution LiDAR pointclouds captured from a helicopter over two Radiata pine forests in NSW, Australia.},

  abstract = {Accurate forest biomass estimation at the individual tree scale is the foundation of timber industry and forest management. It plays an important role in explaining ecological issues and small-scale processes. Remotely sensed images, across a range of spatial and temporal resolutions, with their advantages of non-destructive monitoring, are widely applied in forest biomass monitoring at global, ecoregion or community scales. However, the development of remote sensing applications for forest biomass at the individual tree scale has been relatively slow due to the constraints of spatial resolution and evaluation accuracy of remotely sensed data. With the improvements in platforms and spatial resolutions, as well as the development of remote sensing techniques, the potential for forest biomass estimation at the single tree level has been demonstrated. However, a comprehensive review of remote sensing of forest biomass scaled at individual trees has not been done. This review highlights the theoretical bases, challenges and future perspectives for Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) applications of individual trees scaled to whole forests. We summarize research on estimating individual tree volume and aboveground biomass (AGB) using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Laser Scanning (UAV-LS) and Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS, including Vehicle-borne Laser Scanning (VLS) and Backpack Laser Scanning (BLS)) data.},
