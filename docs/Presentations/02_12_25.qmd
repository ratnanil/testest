# Progress

## Overview

-   Decision to not use the HPC
-   Improve Reproducability
-   Finished Report for Presubmission
-   Implemented Validation
-   Presubmission

## Decision to not use the HPC

-   2000m Grid for LCP Analysis
-   All Start/End nodes are in optimal habitat (dense forest=1)
-   53 valid nodes is perfect (10km = 6 valid nodes)
-   HPC is no longer needed

## Decision to not use the HPC

## Improve Reproducability

-   Still 3 different working files (Surface Preparation, LCP Calculation and Visualisation)

-   run_pipeline.py coordinates these 3 files and ensures that the Code is Reproducible on every Operating System

-   HPC Code is in depriciated_code and could be reused with small changes when a larger area is being investigated

-   OSM data is downloaded automatically for the provided osmnx Geocode, but CLC must be downloaded mannually

-   Automatic Environment Setup integrated

-   Just clone the Repo and start run_pipeline.py and the entire Project runs

## Validation

-   Problems with overlaying Bottlenecks

-   How much Bottlenecks should i Visualize and in how much detail?

## Validation

Quantitative Validation with ZHAW Wildtierunfällen auf Verkehrsinfrastrukturen

![Quantitative Validation: Wildlife Traffic accidents](images/Validation.png)

## Validation

Qualitative Validation with existing Wildlife Passage

# Challenges

## What kind of visualisations/results do i need?

-   Do i have the correct visualisations for analysing my project?

-   Have I chosen the correct validation methods?

-   Correct comparison with ZHAW data?

-   Do I need statistical results that prove the accuracy of my model?

## HPC

Should i discuss the use of the HPC if i don't use it?

-   At the moment, I am not mentioning the use of HPC in my report or on my GitHub.

## Appendix

What should I put in the appendix?

-   The Cost Value table?

-   The Project Structur?

# Next Steps

-   Final test, documentation and improvements in the Code

-   Last revision of the report

-   Start with the Final Presentation
