# Progress

## Overview

-   Optimized Cost Surface Model
-   Apply correct Cost Values
-   Started writing Report
-   Implement Least Cost Analysis
-   Plot deer traffic map

## Cost Surface Model

-   Buffer, Canton borders and clip it to national borders

-   Buffer Linestrings (water and road)

-   Define Mastergrid for aligning the Raster Layers

-   Rasterize Landcover Layers first, then apply a priority fill with np.where()

-   Combine Layers with maximum logic

## Cost Surface Model

## Apply correct Cost Values

## Implement Least Cost Path Analysis

-   `skimage.graph.route_through_array()`

-   `skimage.graph.MCP_Geometric()` is much faster

-   Based on dijkstra algorithm

-   Calculations on HPC using Job Array

-   1 km grid

## Implement Least Cost Path Analysis

# Challenges

## No Data for Germany

SwissTLM3D only offers data for Swiss teretory, while Corine Landcover also delivers data for Germany. But only Landcover for Germany, no Water or roads data.

-   Therefore, I had to adjust my function, first to include the buffer and second to clip the area to the swiss national border.

## Water and Roads Buffer

The water and roads layer are linestrings and therefore difficult to rasterize.

-   I buffered the layers so that they are polygons.

## Handling no Data Values

I had problems by handling the no Data values in the cost surface model.

-   I've set them to a fixed value of -9999

## Cost definition

It is relatively difficult to determine the costs for the different types of landscape, water, and roads.

-   I choose values with respect to literature

## Correct Least Cost Path calculation method

There are different suitable methods, like `skimage.graph.route_through_array()` or `scipy.sparse.csgraph.dijkstra()` or `skimage.graph.MCP_Geometric()`

-   I decided to work with `skimage.graph.route_through_array()` because, it was the only methode which provided good results.

## Starting on the HPC and definition of grid size

I had problems by defining the best possible Grid Size

-   I used a 1km grid size as it provides detailed info but doesn't take too long to calculate.

# Next Steps

-   Improve Least Cost Path Analysis Code
-   Continue writing the Report
-   Define deer Habitats
-   Search for Bottlenecks
-   Add the Steepness from the SwissAlti3D Dataset as a next Cost Surface to the model.
