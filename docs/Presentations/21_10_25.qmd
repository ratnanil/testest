# Challenges

## SwissTLM3D

SwissTLM3D only offers data for the whole of Switzerland for download.

-   Therefore, I had to use additional data from swissBOUNDARIES3D to determine the geographical boundaries of the canton of Schaffhausen and then filter the SwissTLM3D data accordingly.

## Corine Landcover

Corine Land Cover has a classification code for land cover types and a separate file with the legend.

-   I also had to import the legend and merge it with the land cover data using the classification code.

## Combining Landcover

Combining the land cover data was not entirely straightforward, as they use different terminology.

-   I have grouped similar landscape descriptions together and created a map of 11 different landscape types.

## Cost definition

It is relatively difficult to determine the costs for the different types of landscape, water, and roads.

-   I will look for some literature to find standardized costs for the areas.

# Next Steps

-   Add the Steepness from the SwissAlti3D Dataset as a next Cost Surface to the model.
-   Apply Buffer zones around cities or roads.
-   Create a clean Code and outsource functions to a seperate Python file.
-   Start writing the Report (Introduction, Methods)
-   Apply first Least Cost Path Analyses
